# reldesn

Personal website (not finished)

#### Why reldesn?
I previously used `nsedler` (Nate Sedler) as an online alias.  Lately, I have been using the reverse, `reldesn`, as an alias to switch things up.

#### Goals for reldesn
- [x] Showcase past, present, and future projects.
- [ ] Be a fully responsive website.
  - [x] mobile friendly
  - [x] desktop friendly
  - [ ] medium size friendly
- [ ] Backend server for?
  - [ ] Project hosting

  - **What should we use for backend?**
    - Express.js *

    - **But I thought it's reldesn now?** nsedler is friendly and easier to connect to myself.
